*Important*

This is a place holder file for the test files directory.
Many of the tests require files for TMSU and the GUI to
manipulate and to test the functionality of the app. Here 
are some ideas for your corpus of files. Images, MP3s, 
texts, and movies. Ideally mixtures of these sorted by
directories once the app is fleshed out.

##What Is Extended Brain?
Extended brain is a file manager with features that allow the human to remember what is in their files via psychological techniques. It breaks with the tradition of thinking that files are remembered computationally as humans are not computers. Instead it aims to use human psychology to organize folders. So that fewer searching is required. There is a limitation for computers and a limitation for humans and this product hopes to bridge that gap.
##Extended Brain Re-Imagined
The problem with the old program was that it was heavily dependent on TMSU. This meant that development of TMSU especially the API was a blocker. While integration into TMSU is still a goal I want a program that I have full control of.
###API Version 1.0 MVP
* File Sort – Files would further be sorted into easy to remember / visual based directories.
    * File sort command that initiates the sort of the files.
    * Add file to directory pre-execution
    * Add directory to file structure pre-execution
    * Remove file from directory
    * Remove entire directory from pre-execution
* GUI for File sort – Simple Point and click interface for control of the simple process of sending files to their easy directories.
    * Drag and drop to Easy folders.
        * Select file icon
        * Move file icon to directory icon
        * detect drop of file into directory icon
    * File manager – Manages the sorted directories that random files are sorted into.
    * Back and Forward button to get rid of mistakes
    * Execute button to trigger the execution of moves or copies.
    * Option to copy the files instead of move them
###API Version 2.0 Data Base
* Notes DataBase – Notes could be saved and memorized about each file
* Brain Search – Spaced repetition to memorize organized files.
* Database pruning – program detects when files have been deleted and updates lists automatically.
###API Version 3.0 Tagging
* Dup Tag – a duplicate marker system where the user marks a file as a dup
* File Tag – memorable tags that the user can search for
* Stretch goal:
    * Version Control – A user can restore saved versions of tags and the database from version control
* Create a tag by dragging and dropping file onto another file
###API Version 4.0 CLI
* Command Line – Shell commands for common tag manipulation.
###API Version 5.0 Offline File Storage
* The program zips files
* The program creates .img files for burning to cds
* The program remembers and indexes backups for memorization
###Old ideas
* Brain Search – Spaced repetition to memorize organized files.
* Browser Integration – Walk through book marks and organize them
* Command Line – Shell commands for common tag manipulation.
* Dup Tag – a duplicate marker system where the user marks a file as a dup
* File Sort – Files would further be sorted into easy to remember / look through directories.
* File Storage – Zip files onto storage medium for backup with a list saved for memorizing
* File Tag – memorable tags that the user can search for
* Multiple Users – multiple users can use the same program
* Notes Data – Notes could be saved and memorized about each file
* GUI – Point and click interface for control of advanced options
* Version Control – A user can restore saved versions of tags and the database from version control

###New Ideas
* Database pruning – program detects when files have been deleted and updates lists automatically.

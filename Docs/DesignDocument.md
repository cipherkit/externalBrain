##Extended Brain Re-Imagined
The problem with the old program was that it was heavily dependent on TMSU. This meant that development of TMSU especially the API was a blocker. While integration into TMSU is still a goal I want a program that I have full control of.
###Old ideas
* Brain Search – Spaced repetition to memorize organized files.
* Browser Integration – Walk through book marks and organize them
* Command Line – Shell commands for common tag manipulation.
* Dup Tag – a duplicate marker system where the user marks a file as a dup
* File Sort – Files would further be sorted into easy to remember / look through directories.
* File Storage – Zip files onto storage medium for backup with a list saved for memorizing
* File Tag – memorable tags that the user can search for
* Multiple Users – multiple users can use the same program
* Notes Data – Notes could be saved and memorized about each file
* GUI – Point and click interface for control of advanced options
* Version Control – A user can restore saved versions of tags and the database from version control

###New Ideas
* Database pruning – program detects when files have been deleted and updates lists automatically.

###API Version 1.0 MVP
* File Sort – Files would further be sorted into easy to remember / look through directories.
* Directory manager – Manages the sorted directories that random files are sorted into.
* GUI – Point and click interface for control of advanced options

###API Version 2.0 Data Base
* Notes Data – Notes could be saved and memorized about each file
* Brain Search – Spaced repetition to memorize organized files.
* Database pruning – program detects when files have been deleted and updates lists automatically.

###API Version 3.0 Tagging
* Dup Tag – a duplicate marker system where the user marks a file as a dup
* File Tag – memorable tags that the user can search for
* Stretch goal:
    * Version Control – A user can restore saved versions of tags and the database from version control

###API Version 4.0 CLI
* Command Line – Shell commands for common tag manipulation.
